# ZimaCube Experience Blog

> **Disclosure:** I received this hardware free through the [Zima Pioneer Programme](posts/meta/disclaimer.md). I've also reviewed previous Zima products (Blade, Board). This creates bias. I am committed to honest writing regardless — if something annoys me, you'll hear about it. [Read the full disclosure →](posts/meta/disclaimer.md)

A running journal of my time with the [ZimaCube](https://www.zimaboard.com/) — not a formal review, just notes, experiments, and one slightly overkill homelab project.

## The Standout Experiment So Far

Treating this compact little NAS box as a bare-metal Windows Server 2025 host. It was a weird fit. That's exactly why I tried it.
